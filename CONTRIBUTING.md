   cd dev-containers-template
   ```

2. **Test the Configuration**
   - Open the project in VS Code
   - Use "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container" to test the current setup
   - Verify Git and SSH configuration works correctly

3. **Test on Different Platforms**
   - If possible, test changes on macOS, Linux, and Windows
   - Test with different base images and Git configurations

### Making Changes

1. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow the [Style Guidelines](#style-guidelines)
   - Test your changes thoroughly
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Test Your Changes**

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
Test your changes with:

- [ ] **Different Operating Systems**
  - [ ] macOS host
  - [ ] Linux host
  - [ ] Windows host (if possible)

- [ ] **Different Git Configurations**
  - [ ] Basic user.name and user.email
  - [ ] GPG signing enabled
  - [ ] Custom SSH config
  - [ ] Git aliases and custom settings
  - [ ] Missing .gitconfig file

- [ ] **Different Base Images**
  - [ ] Language-specific images (Python, Node.js, etc.)
  - [ ] Platform images (Ubuntu, Alpine, etc.)
  - [ ] Universal image

- [ ] **Edge Cases**
  - [ ] No SSH keys present
  - [ ] Malformed .gitconfig
  - [ ] Permission issues
  - [ ] Network connectivity issues

### Test Scenarios
Create test cases for:
1. Fresh installation with no existing Git config
2. Existing Git config with GPG signing
3. Custom SSH config with non-standard ports
4. Git config with relative paths (~/...)
5. Missing or corrupted SSH keys

## Style Guidelines

### Bash Scripts (`setup-git.sh`)
- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang
- Enable strict mode: `set -euo pipefail`
- Use meaningful variable names in UPPER_CASE
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Handle errors gracefully with informative messages
- Use color-coded output for better UX

### JSON Configuration (`devcontainer.json`)
- Use consistent indentation (tabs, as per VS Code convention)
- Include comments where helpful
- Keep the critical sections (mounts, containerEnv, etc.) unchanged
- Validate JSON syntax

### Documentation
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Keep line length reasonable (80-100 characters)
- Use proper Markdown formatting
- Include cross-references between related sections

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for test-related changes
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add support for custom SSH agent socket paths
fix: handle Windows path translation for GPG keys
