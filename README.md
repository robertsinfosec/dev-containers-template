## What are VS Code "Dev Containers"?

VS Code Dev Containers is a powerful feature that allows you to use a Docker container as a complete development environment. When you open a project in VS Code, it can automatically spin up a containerized environment with all the tools, libraries, and dependencies your project needs, creating a consistent development experience across different machines and team members.

Key benefits include:
- **Isolated environments**: Each project gets its own containerized environment
- **Reproducible setups**: Same environment for all developers on your team
- **Tool consistency**: Specific versions of languages, frameworks, and tools
- **Easy onboarding**: New team members can start coding immediately

## Why use Dev Containers?

Dev Containers solve several common development pain points:

### Environment Consistency
- Eliminates "works on my machine" problems
- Ensures all team members use identical development environments
- Prevents version conflicts between different projects

### Simplified Setup
- No need to install multiple language runtimes or tools locally
- Automatic dependency management
- Pre-configured development tools and extensions

### Project Isolation
- Different projects can use different versions of the same tools
- Avoid polluting your host machine with project-specific dependencies
- Easy to experiment with new tools without affecting other projects

### Onboarding Speed
- New developers can be productive in minutes, not hours or days
- No lengthy setup documentation or manual configuration steps
- Consistent experience regardless of host operating system

## Common Dev Container "Gotchas"

While Dev Containers are powerful, there are several common issues that can frustrate developers:

### 1. Git Configuration Loss
By default, your personal Git configuration (name, email, signing keys, aliases) doesn't transfer to the container. This means:
- Commits may appear as coming from "unknown" authors
- GPG signing won't work without additional setup
- Custom Git aliases and settings are unavailable
- Authentication credentials aren't automatically available

### 2. SSH Key Accessibility
SSH keys stored on your host machine aren't automatically available in the container, causing:
- Inability to clone private repositories
- Failed authentication when pushing to remote repositories
- Need to recreate or copy SSH keys manually
- Loss of SSH config settings for custom hosts

### 3. Path Translation Issues
Different operating systems use different path structures:
- macOS: `/Users/username/`
- Linux: `/home/username/`
- Windows: `/c/Users/username/`
- Container: `/home/vscode/` (when using the default `vscode` user)

This creates problems when trying to mount or reference files between host and container.

## What This Template Solves

This repository provides a complete solution that addresses all the common gotchas mentioned above. The [.devcontainer](.devcontainer) folder contains two key files:

### `devcontainer.json` - Container Configuration
This file handles the Docker container setup and critical mounts:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Project",
  "image": "your-base-image",
  "features": {
    // Your required dev container features
  },
  "containerEnv": {
    "SSH_AUTH_SOCK": "/tmp/ssh-agent.sock"
  },
  "mounts": [
    "source=${localEnv:HOME}/.ssh,target=/home/vscode/.ssh,type=bind,consistency=cached",
    "source=${localEnv:HOME}/.gitconfig,target=/tmp/host-gitconfig,type=bind,consistency=cached,readonly"
  ],
  "postCreateCommand": "chmod +x .devcontainer/setup-git.sh && .devcontainer/setup-git.sh",
  "remoteUser": "vscode"
}
```

**Key features:**
- **SSH Agent Support**: Sets up SSH agent socket for authentication
- **SSH Key Mount**: Safely mounts your `~/.ssh` directory from host to container
- **Git Config Mount**: Mounts your host `.gitconfig` to a temporary location for processing
- **Automatic Setup**: Runs the setup script after container creation

### `setup-git.sh` - Intelligent Configuration Script
This Bash script handles the complex task of translating your host Git configuration to work properly in the container:

**What it does:**
1. **SSH Permission Fix**: Ensures proper file permissions on SSH keys and config
2. **Path Translation**: Automatically converts host paths to container paths for signing keys
3. **Git Config Processing**: Reads your host Git configuration and applies it to the container
4. **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on macOS, Linux, and Windows hosts
5. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing files and provides helpful feedback

**Path translation examples:**
- `/Users/john/.ssh/id_rsa` ‚Üí `/home/vscode/.ssh/id_rsa` (macOS to container)
- `/home/john/.ssh/id_rsa` ‚Üí `/home/vscode/.ssh/id_rsa` (Linux to container)
- `~/.ssh/id_rsa` ‚Üí `/home/vscode/.ssh/id_rsa` (relative to absolute)

**Git configuration preserved:**
- User name and email
- GPG signing configuration and keys
- Git aliases and custom settings
- SSH configuration for custom hosts

## How to Use This Template

### 1. Copy the Configuration Files
Copy the `.devcontainer` folder and its contents to your project root:
```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .devcontainer/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ devcontainer.json
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ setup-git.sh
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### 2. Customize for Your Tech Stack
Edit the `devcontainer.json` file to match your project's requirements:

```json
{
  "name": "My Python Project",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.11",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/git-lfs:1": {},
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli:1": {},
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:1": {}
  },
  // ... keep the rest of the configuration unchanged
}
```

**Important**: Only modify the `name`, `image`, and `features` sections. The `containerEnv`, `mounts`, `postCreateCommand`, and `remoteUser` sections are critical for the Git/SSH functionality.

### 3. Open in Dev Container
1. Open your project in VS Code
2. Press `F1` and run "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
3. VS Code will build the container and run the setup script automatically
4. Your Git config and SSH keys will be ready to use!

## Troubleshooting

### SSH Keys Not Working
- Ensure your SSH keys exist in `~/.ssh/` on your host machine
- Check that key files have proper permissions (600 for private keys)
- Verify your SSH config is properly formatted

### Git Signing Issues
- Make sure your GPG keys are available on the host
- Check that the signing key path in your Git config is correct
- The script will automatically translate paths, but the keys must exist

### Permission Errors
- The setup script automatically fixes SSH permissions
- If you encounter issues, the script provides detailed error messages
- Check the container logs for specific error details
